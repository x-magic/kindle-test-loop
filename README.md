# Kindle Battery Test Loop

## About this project
This is a KUAL-based script to test how long your Kindle would last when using [Kindle Weather Stand Project](https://github.com/x-magic/kindle-weather-stand-alone). 

This script has a wakeup time of every 15 minutes instead of the Weather Stand's 1 hour. Honestly, it doesn't make a difference anyway. 

## Disclaimer
This script would disable a lot of system services. It's only tested on Kindle 4 Silver Non-touch version. Use at your own risk!
